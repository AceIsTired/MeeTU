The services/things I have:
- A custom domain
- A "dance index" spreadsheet that will hold the following information on the cover groups for the semester
	- Cover group leader name
	- Group Song Name
	- Total number of group members
	- Dance difficulty rating (Easy, Intermediate, Hard)
	- Current members names

- A Box account to hold pictures in
- A github repository to host the pages

The page structure I want:
- About Us
- Home
- Gallery
- Dance
  - Weekly Classes
  - Cover Groups
- Events


Sites to get code/design reference from:
- https://www.lars-olson.com//?ref=prettyfolio
- https://www.marco.fyi//?ref=prettyfolio
- https://mooeyandfriends.com
- https://cinni.net


Instructions:
In the cover groups page, I want there to be a section that lists all the documented dance groups based on
each row in a Google Spreadsheet

In the gallery, I want it to display sections of photos that will be pulled from an online drive (like Box or 1TB)
